# React + Vite

Build a new website (a free one) with a responsive design that features a header and footer, including a hero section with an H1, a paragraph, and an image as key components. 

For the images, use the results from task number 2.

Below the hero section should be a testimonial section with three columns. Each column has a placeholder name, photo, and paragraph.

Below the testimonial section is a gallery with two columns. The content for this section must be alternating between photos and text. 

1st row: Photo - Text
2nd row: Text - Photo
3rd row: Photo - Text
4th row: Text - Photo

Each section must be marked at the beginning by a “This is the [section title] section” heading. All other elements besides the images can be labeled as “This is a [element title]”.
